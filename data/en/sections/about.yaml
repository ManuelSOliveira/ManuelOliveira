# a summary about you
summary: "**Engineering leader with 10+ years of experience building teams and architecting next-generation semiconductor solutions**, currently leading the Silicon Logic Design Team at Axelera AI as we develop breakthrough AI processors for edge computing.


From my foundations as an intern at Synopsys through progressive technical leadership roles, I've cultivated deep expertise in **RTL design, formal verification, and SoC integration** — while discovering my passion for **building and empowering high-performing engineering teams**.


As Engineering Manager at Axelera AI, I lead a multidisciplinary team developing **AI hardware platforms** that leverage proprietary in-memory computing and RISC-V dataflow technology, delivering exceptional performance at a fraction of traditional power consumption. I balance hands-on technical contributions with strategic leadership: defining technical roadmaps, fostering team growth, and ensuring we deliver silicon excellence on schedule.


**Leadership & Technical Expertise**:


- Team leadership and talent development—mentoring engineers from junior to staff level


- Strategic technical planning and cross-functional coordination across architecture, verification, and physical design teams


- Advanced RTL design and formal verification strategies ensuring mathematical proof of design correctness


- Complex SoC integration with rigorous timing, power, and functional management


- Intelligent automation frameworks and Python tooling that accelerate development cycles


- Process optimisation and methodology establishment to enhance team productivity


Beyond industry leadership, I serve as an **Invited Teaching Assistant** at the Faculty of Engineering, University of Porto, sharing knowledge in Computer Architecture and shaping the next generation of hardware engineers.


My approach combines technical precision with people-first leadership—building teams that don't just meet specifications, but push the boundaries of what's possible in AI acceleration.


> \"Building exceptional teams that transform visionary concepts into silicon reality.\""
